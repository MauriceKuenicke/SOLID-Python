# SOLID-Python

A Python repository that demonstrates the 'SOLID' design principles using examples.

- ``S``RP: The Single Responsibility Principle
- ``O``CP: The Open-Closed Principle
- ``L``SP: The Liskov Substitution Principle
- ``I``SP: The Interface Segregation Principle
- ``D``IP: The Dependency Inversion Principle

---------------------
## [SRP](https://github.com/MauriceKuenicke/SOLID-Python/tree/main/00_SRP)
```
The best structure for a software system is heavily influenced by the social structure of the organization that uses it so that each software module has one, and only one, reason to change.
```

## [OCP](https://github.com/MauriceKuenicke/SOLID-Python/tree/main/01_OCP)
```
For software systems to be easy to change, they must be designed to allow the behaviour of those systems to be changed by adding new code, rather than changing existing code.
```
## [LSP](https://github.com/MauriceKuenicke/SOLID-Python/tree/main/02_LSP)
```
To build software systems from interchangeable parts, those parts must adhere to a contract that allows those parts to be substituted one for another.
```
## [ISP](https://github.com/MauriceKuenicke/SOLID-Python/tree/main/03_ISP)
```
This principle advises software designers to avoid depending on things that they don't use.
```
## [DIP](https://github.com/MauriceKuenicke/SOLID-Python/tree/main/04_DIP)
```
The code that implements high-level policy should not depend on the code that implements low-level details. Rather, details should depend on policies.
